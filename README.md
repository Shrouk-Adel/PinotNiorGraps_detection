# Pinot Noir Grapes Cluster Detection
This project focuses on detecting Pinot Noir grape clusters using the YOLOv11 architecture, providing insights for applications in agriculture like yield estimation and disease detection.

# Project Overview
Detecting individual grape clusters can support various agricultural analyses, such as monitoring grape growth, estimating yield, and identifying diseases early. This project uses the YOLOv11 architecture with pretrained weights for accurate and efficient grape cluster detection.

# Dataset Description
Source: Captured with an iPad Air 2 RGB camera.
Resolution: 8 megapixels (3226x2449).
Data Size: Approximately 100 images after preprocessing.
Annotations: Annotated using LabelImg.
